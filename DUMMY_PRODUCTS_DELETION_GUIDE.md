## How to Clean Your Database

### Option 1: Run the SQL Script Directly
```bash
# Execute the deletion script in your Supabase SQL editor
cat delete_dummy_products.sql
```

### Option 2: Use the Migration File
```bash
# Apply the deletion migration
supabase migration up
```

### Option 3: Manual Cleanup in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run this command:
```sql
-- Delete all products and categories
DELETE FROM public.products;
DELETE FROM public.categories;
DELETE FROM public.grocery_lists;
DELETE FROM public.group_grocery_lists;

-- Reset sequences
ALTER SEQUENCE public.products_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
ALTER SEQUENCE public.categories_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
```

## Next Steps

After cleaning the database:

1. **🏢 Set Up Real Categories**: Use the admin panel to create actual product categories
2. **📦 Add Real Products**: Use the brand management system to add real products
3. **👥 User Testing**: Test the app with clean, production-ready data
4. **🔄 Data Verification**: Verify all features work with empty product catalogs

## Database State

Your database now has:
- ✅ **Clean product tables** - No dummy data
- ✅ **Reset sequences** - IDs will start from 1
- ✅ **Intact structure** - All tables, functions, and policies remain
- ✅ **Production ready** - Ready for real data entry

The app will now start with empty product catalogs, allowing admins to add real categories and brands to add real products through the proper admin interface.
