# Currency Consistency Fix üí±

## Problem Identified
The user reported seeing mixed currency symbols (USD in some places, INR in others) despite setting a preferred currency.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Components Using Currency Correctly ‚úÖ
Most components are already using the proper currency system:
- `BudgetManagement.tsx` - Uses `formatPrice(amount, currency)`
- `Index.tsx` / `Index_FIXED.tsx` - Uses `formatPrice(product.price, currency)`
- `GroupGroceryList.tsx` - Uses `formatPrice(price, currency)`
- `SplitBill.tsx` - Uses `formatPrice(amount, currency)`

### Issues Found ‚ùå

#### 1. **RazorpayPaymentDialog.tsx** (CORRUPTED FILE)
- File became corrupted during editing attempts
- Contains hardcoded `‚Çπ` symbols instead of dynamic currency
- Need to restore and fix properly

#### 2. **razorpayService.ts** (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- Had hardcoded `‚Çπ${amount}` in toast messages
- Fixed to use generic amount display

#### 3. **Currency Persistence Issue**
- Possible browser cache or localStorage conflict
- Need to verify currency is properly saved and loaded

## Comprehensive Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Fix RazorpayPaymentDialog (Primary Issue)
The main component causing currency inconsistency needs to be restored and properly fixed to use:
```javascript
// Instead of: ‚Çπ{amount.toFixed(2)}
// Use: {formatPrice(amount, currency)}
```

### Step 2: Verify Currency System
- Check if currency is properly persisted in user profile
- Ensure CurrencySelector updates both database and localStorage
- Verify all components receive updated currency state

### Step 3: Cache and State Refresh
- Clear browser localStorage if needed
- Force re-render of components after currency change
- Ensure React state updates propagate correctly

## Debugging Information

### Currency System Architecture
```
User selects currency ‚Üí CurrencySelector updates:
1. Database (profile.currency)
2. localStorage (preferred-currency)
3. React state (useCurrency hook)
4. All components re-render with new currency
```

### Expected Behavior
- All price displays should use the same currency
- Currency symbol should be consistent throughout the app
- Currency changes should update immediately without page reload

## Temporary Diagnostic Tool
Added `CurrencyDiagnostic` component to show:
- Current currency from hook
- Profile currency from database
- localStorage currency value
- Sample formatted price

## Next Steps

1. **Restore RazorpayPaymentDialog.tsx** from a clean version
2. **Apply currency fixes** using formatPrice and getCurrencySymbol
3. **Test currency changes** to ensure consistency
4. **Remove diagnostic component** after verification
5. **Clear any cached states** if issues persist

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `razorpayService.ts` - Removed hardcoded ‚Çπ symbol
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `RazorpayPaymentDialog.tsx` - Needs restoration and fix
- ‚ûï `CurrencyDiagnostic.tsx` - Temporary debugging component
- ‚úÖ `BudgetManagement.tsx` - Added diagnostic component

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Change currency in settings
- [ ] Verify budget page shows consistent currency
- [ ] Check product prices use same currency
- [ ] Test bill splitting currency display
- [ ] Confirm payment dialogs use correct currency
- [ ] Validate no hardcoded symbols remain

The main issue appears to be in the payment-related components that may still have hardcoded currency symbols. Once these are fixed to use the dynamic currency system, all displays should be consistent! üéØ
