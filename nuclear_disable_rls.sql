-- NUCLEAR OPTION: Completely disable RLS to get groups working
-- This removes all security temporarily but fixes the infinite recursion
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Disable RLS completely on both tables
ALTER TABLE groups DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE group_memberships DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop ALL policies to ensure clean slate
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "groups_simple_2024" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "memberships_simple_2024" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "groups_all_access_2024" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "memberships_all_access_2024" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_all_groups_2024" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_all_memberships_2024" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_groups_select_2024" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_groups_insert_2024" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_groups_update_2024" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_memberships_select_2024" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_memberships_select_enhanced_2024" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_memberships_insert_2024" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_memberships_update_2024" ON group_memberships;

-- 3. Verify RLS is disabled
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('groups', 'group_memberships');

-- 4. Test basic access
SELECT 'RLS completely disabled - groups should work now' as status;
SELECT COUNT(*) as groups_count FROM groups;
SELECT COUNT(*) as memberships_count FROM group_memberships;
