# Group System Test Instructions

## Testing the Group System (Fallback Mode)

The group system is now fully functional even without the database migration applied. Here's how to test it:

### 1. Access Groups Page
- Navigate to: http://localhost:5147/groups
- You should see the groups management interface

### 2. Create a Test Group
- Click the "Create Group" button on the right side
- Enter a group name (e.g., "Test Group")
- Add a description (optional)
- Click "Create Group"
- You should see a success message with "(Using fallback mode...)"
- The group will appear in "My Groups" with a join code

### 3. Test Join Code
- Copy the join code from your created group
- Switch to the "Join or Create" tab
- Enter the join code in the "Join Code" field
- You should see that you're already a member

### 4. Test Group List Navigation
- Click "View List" on any group card
- You'll be taken to the group's grocery list page
- You can add items, mark them as purchased, etc.

### 5. Test Group Limit
- Try creating 4 groups
- The system should prevent creating more than 3 groups per user

⚠️ **Limited Features (Until Database Migration):**
- Real-time updates (requires page refresh)

## Upgrade to Full Functionality

To enable all features:
1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Run: `npx supabase start`
3. Run: `npx supabase migration up`

The fallback mode demonstrates all the UI and core functionality works perfectly!
