# Database Fix Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

Your admin panel is working correctly, but there are some database RLS (Row Level Security) policy issues causing 500 errors.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to the **SQL Editor**

### 2. Run the Database Fix
Copy and paste the contents of `database_rls_fix.sql` into the SQL Editor and execute it.

**Or manually run these commands:**

```sql
-- Fix RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion
-- First, drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view groups they're members of" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create groups" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own groups" ON groups;

-- Create simpler, non-recursive policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all active groups" ON groups
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (is_active = true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create groups" ON groups
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = leader_id);

CREATE POLICY "Group leaders can update their groups" ON groups
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = leader_id AND is_active = true);

-- Fix group_memberships policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own memberships" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can join groups" ON group_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can leave groups" ON group_memberships;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own memberships" ON group_memberships
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can join groups" ON group_memberships
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own memberships" ON group_memberships
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE groups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE group_memberships ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 3. Check Database Status
After running the fix:
1. Go back to your Admin Panel
2. Click **"Refresh"** on the Database Status card
3. All tables should show "OK" status

## Current Issues Fixed:

‚úÖ **Admin Access**: Working correctly
